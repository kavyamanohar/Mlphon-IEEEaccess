    abstract = "Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) has many applications in NLP and speech fields. Most existing work focuses heavily on languages with abundant training datasets, which limits the scope of target languages to less than 100 languages. This work attempts to apply zero-shot learning to approximate G2P models for all low-resource and endangered languages in Glottolog (about 8k languages). For any unseen target language, we first build the phylogenetic tree (i.e. language family tree) to identify top-$k$ nearest languages for which we have training sets. Then we run models of those languages to obtain a hypothesis set, which we combine into a confusion network to propose a most likely hypothesis as an approximation to the target language. We test our approach on over 600 unseen languages and demonstrate it significantly outperforms baselines.",

abstract="The two key components of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems are language modeling and acoustic modeling. The language model generates a lexicon, which is a pronunciation dictionary. A lexicon can be created using a variety of approaches. For low-resource languages, rule-based methods are typically employed to build the lexicon. However, because the corpus is often tiny, this methodology does not account for all possible pronunciation variances. As a result, low-resource languages like Malayalam require a method for developing a comprehensive lexicon as the corpus grows. In this work, we explored deep learning based encoder-decoder models for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion in Malayalam. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) encoder models with varying embedding dimensions were used to create the encoder model. The performance of the deep learning models used for G2P conversion was measured using the Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER). With 1024 embedding dimensions, the encoder using the BiLSTM model had the maximum accuracy of 98.04{\%} and the lowest PER of 2.57{\%} at the phoneme level, and the highest accuracy of 90.58{\%} and the lowest WER of 9.42{\%} at the word level.",

lexicon for Turkish using finite state technology. The system produces at its output,
a parallel representation of the pronunciation and the morphological analysis of the
word form so that further disambiguation processes can be used to disambiguate pronunciation.
The pronunciation representation is based on the SAMPA standard and also encodes the
position of the primary stress. The computation of the position of the primary stress
depends on an interplay of any exceptional stress in root words and stress properties
of certain morphemes, and requires that a full morphological analysis be done. The
system has been implemented using XRCE Finite State Toolkit.},

Text-to-speech systems for such languages will thus be extremely beneficial for wide-spread content creation and accessibility. Despite this, the current TTS systems for even the most popular Indian languages fall short of the contemporary state-of-the-art systems for English, Chinese, etc. We believe that one of the major reasons for this is the lack of large, publicly available text-to-speech corpora in these languages that are suitable for training neural text-to-speech systems. To mitigate this, we release a 24 hour text-to-speech corpus for 3 major Indian languages namely Hindi, Malayalam and Bengali. In this work, we also train a state-of-the-art TTS system for each of these languages and report their performances. The collected corpus, code, and trained models are made publicly available.",

ABSTRACT = {This article presents a rule-based grapheme-to-phoneme conversion method and algorithm for Polish. It should be noted that the fundamental grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules have been developed by Maria Steffen-Bat&oacute;g and presented in her set of monographs dedicated to the automatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion of texts in Polish. The author used previously developed rules and independently developed the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion algorithm.The algorithm has been implemented as a software application called TransFon, which allows the user to convert any text in Polish orthography to corresponding strings of phonemes, in phonemic transcription. Using TransFon, a phonemic Polish language corpus was created out of an orthographic corpus. The phonemic language corpusallows statistical analysis of the Polish language, as well as the development of phoneme- and word-based language models for automatic speech recognition using statistical methods. The developed phonemic language corpus opens up further opportunities for research to improve automatic speech recognition in Polish. The development of statistical methods for speech recognition and language modelling requires access to large language corpora, including phonemic corpora. The method presented here enables the creation of such corpora.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {We describe a novel way to implement subword language models in speech recognition systems based on weighted finite state transducers, hidden Markov models, and deep neural networks. The acoustic models are built on graphemes in a way that no pronunciation dictionaries are needed, and they can be used together with any type of subword language model, including character models. The advantages of short subword units are good lexical coverage, reduced data sparsity, and avoiding vocabulary mismatches in adaptation. Moreover, constructing neural network language models (NNLMs) is more practical, because the input and output layers are small. We also propose methods for combining the benefits of different types of language model units by reconstructing and combining the recognition lattices. We present an extensive evaluation of various subword units on speech datasets of four languages: Finnish, Swedish, Arabic, and English. The results show that the benefits of short subwords are even more consistent with NNLMs than with traditional n-gram language models. Combination across different acoustic models and language models with various units improve the results further. For all the four datasets we obtain the best results published so far. Our approach performs well even for English, where the phoneme-based acoustic models and word-based language models typically dominate: The phoneme-based baseline performance can be reached and improved by 4% using graphemes only when several grapheme-based models are combined. Furthermore, combining both grapheme and phoneme models yields the state-of-the-art error rate of 15.9% for the MGB 2018 dev17b test. For all four languages we also show that the language models perform reasonably well when only limited training data is available.}
